# CASA Example - Trunk and Branch

This examples demonstrates a use case where the user is allowed to jump to-and-fro between "branches" of an overall journey, rather than following a linear sequence of waypoints.

This is quite a common pattern where you have a "task list" page from which the user can jump into any journey.


## Getting started

```bash
# Install everything
npm install

# Start the app in debug mode, on port 3000
DEBUG=casa* PORT=3000 npm start
```

Access the service at http://localhost:3000/trunk
